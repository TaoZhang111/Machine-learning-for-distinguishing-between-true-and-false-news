The /r/fakenews FAQ,"**What is ""fake news""?**  

""Fake news"" is not a new concept but the digital age has given it a new powerful platform to spread material to millions of users. Fake news is a cousin of ""bad news"", which ranges from subtle mainstream media bias to lazy writing and poor fact checking. Fake news is a more blatant iteration of this and is often spread for political purposes. Fake news appears as blogs or ""news"" sites that seem comparable to mainstream news sites. For the sake of discussion and broadening the purposes of this subreddit, we are also including memes, fake quotes, and other bad information that is spread online.  

*********

**Who is involved with fake news?**  

Bad information is spread via a direct process along these lines:  
Originators ---> High Level Spreaders ---> Low Level Spreaders  

*Originators* are the individuals who actually create the fake content to spread. Often they are post-truth trolls or political propagandists. There is a gradient from isolated trolls who do it for its own sake to those who actually make a living off of it, as shown when the Washington Post [interviewed an originator](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/17/facebook-fake-news-writer-i-think-donald-trump-is-in-the-white-house-because-of-me/?utm_term=.ab9d09799055):  

>Paul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he’s British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. “South Park” lawsuit last year.  

A High Level Spreader is a larger operation (blog, popular facebook group, fake news website) that spreads the material to a large audience with very little effort. Generally an originator will also run a high level spreading operation at the same time, making it easier for them.  

Finally, a Low Level Spreader is the consumer. These are the users who ""consume"" the fake material and then also spread it via ""likes"" and ""shares"".  

************

**Is fake news a partisan issue?**  

No! We'd all like to think that our ""side"" is consuming real information while fake news is a problem of the other side. But in reality this is a bipartisan issue that will require people to introspect a little and be more vigilant in how they consume media.  

Hyperpartisan Facebook groups have been spreading misleading information at an alarming rate. While it seems to be a bigger issue on the right, it's a [problem for everyone](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/partisan-fb-pages-analysis?utm_term=.tlZxP6zld#.baawQlAEe):  

>Hyperpartisan political Facebook pages and websites are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information, according to an analysis by BuzzFeed News. The review of more than 1,000 posts from six large hyperpartisan Facebook pages selected from the right and from the left also found that the least accurate pages generated some of the highest numbers of shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook — far more than the three large mainstream political news pages analyzed for comparison.  

>Our analysis of three hyperpartisan right-wing Facebook pages found that 38% of all posts were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false, compared to 19% of posts from three hyperpartisan left-wing pages that were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false. The right-wing pages are among the forces — perhaps as potent as the cable news shows that have gotten far more attention — that helped fuel the rise of Donald Trump.  

As noted this isn't simply a right wing problem. To provide one example on the other side: A quote spread around online about Trump calling Republican voters ""stupid"" was used to hurt him among voters both in the primaries and the general elections. The issue? [It's totally fake](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/10/politics/trump-quote-facebook-trnd/).

>That viral meme your friends keep sharing of Donald Trump calling Republicans ""the dumbest group of voters in the country"" is not true. It's not a thing. Stop sharing it.  

>While Donald Trump has said some questionable things, he never said anything even resembling this quote:  

>""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""  

>The post says The Donald made the statement in a People Magazine interview in 1998. Except he didn't.  

***************

**Can you provide a real world example of the fake news process?**  

Absolutely!  

On October 7th, 2016, Wikileaks began to publish the contents of the Podesta e-mails they were holding. Around this time there was a story spreading online that Hillary called Bernie supporters a ""bucket of losers"". This quote was found in a transcript of a Goldman Sachs speech and was supposedly referenced in one of the e-mails.  

Infowars, via The American Mirror, [published this material](http://archive.is/ivBam) to their web site under the title ""HILLARY CALLS HER OWN SUPPORTERS A BUCKET OF LOSERS"".  

Gateway Pundit also reproduced the story: [Wikileaks: Hillary Clinton Calls Bernie Fans and Millennials “Bucket of Losers” in Goldman Sachs Speech](http://archive.is/Kdyvo)  

The story was also spread via the popular /r/the_donald subreddit getting multiple posts with hundreds and thousands of net upvotes. [This example here](https://unreddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/56f857/hillary_clinton_called_bernie_supporters_a_bucket/?) shows it being posted and the mods deleted all the comments trying to notify people the story is fake (deleted comments are in red). The truth of the story was irrelevant.  

The Originator of this story was a fake news outfit called ""Real. True. News."" posing as a legitimate source of information. [Their story can be seen here](http://archive.is/ssqTd). If you pay any attention to details you will notice immediately that the story is dated October 3, 2016, before the Podesta e-mails began to leak.  

One could also go directly to the source (Wikileaks) to see. A search for ""bucket of losers"" in the Podesta e-mail database [returns no results](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=%22bucket+of+losers%22&mfrom=&mto=&title=&notitle=&date_from=&date_to=&nofrom=&noto=&count=50&sort=0#searchresult). If people are unwilling to do ten seconds of research then what else can be spread? If you're a fake news troll, the world is your oyster.   

*************

**Can you provide an example of a spreader manipulating readers?**  

While some fake news stories are totally false, a lot of them start with a grain of truth. This example is also from the Podesta e-mails. Specifically this one written by Podesta himself:  

>I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I'm running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion. I think if she doesn't say it once, people will notice and say we false started in Iowa.  

If you actually read the e-mail and understand its context you will know that they are referring to the term ""everyday Americans"" and not the people who make up the group designated as ""everyday Americans"".  

Do you think that's what the politically motivated fake news spreaders want you to think? The usual suspects went to work:  

Gatewaypundit: [WIKILEAKS BOMBSHELL: Hillary Advisors Admit She “HATES EVERYDAY AMERICANS”](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wikileaks-bombshell-hillary-advisors-admit-hates-everyday-americans/)  

Infowars: [WIKILEAKS BOMBSHELL: HILLARY CLINTON ‘HATES EVERYDAY AMERICANS’](http://archive.is/H33fL), written by Paul Joseph Watson, who had to later take down the article in shame. But he already got his message out, right?  

WND: [Hillary campaign manager: 'I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans'](http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/new-email-leak-hillary-hates-everyday-americans/)  

Drudge: [Season of the Witch: Hates Everyday Americans](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qST-fXJfYxAoRMaaReaE9IYy7XdlhW-DvdbqP7-6eqgQQxmCgoTetzfnp57MVARk_fvdU-LK5uR53x-QsJPtPAUffojjIDovwDC6PqdqrnDLgLbTqQevA6qH7IWjHLM0v58npzs)  

I will focus in on the Infowars article to show further how readers are manipulated. Most readers have short attention spans so they do not read entire articles. That's why it's so important for writers to know that they need to either 1) make an impression early to keep the reader interested or 2) emphasis what you want at the top.  

The (now removed) Infowars story bolds their summary at the very top and doesn't quote the statement in its proper context:  

>New Wikileaks emails released just moments ago include a shocking admission by Clinton campaign manager John Podesta that Hillary Clinton “has begun to hate everyday Americans”.  

Another warning sign to readers: be skeptical of sites that highlight certain sentences or words in bold lettering or caps. It's a form of editorializing without explicitly editorializing. By bolding words the author is telling the reader what is important. But that's not their job, they should be presenting the information and the reader will decide what is important. Paul Joseph Watson uses bold two more times in the article and this shows how shady and manipulative their operation is:  

>“**I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans**, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I’m running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion,” writes Podesta.  

^ Bolding only one part of the statement and not providing a proper explanation of what the statement actually meant. And further down:   

>This is **huge**.  

So if you just skimmed the page you would come away with two concepts: 1) Hillary hates everyday Americans and 2) this story is huge. This is subtle manipulation - you may not have consciously noticed it the first time, but your brain did.

Crowdsourcing platform to fight fake news,"The screenshots below illustrate how the user with the extension will see the alternate titles made by Remedia userssion

i have created a crowdsourcing platform that has a social media network and a Chrome extension that enables users to create and join groups.  Users can create exposing articles and link them to fake news pages, by doing that they will help others because the extension will show a warning and allow the user to read the exposed article.

By installing the [Remedia Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/remedia/lhikhmhnjmdjgioifdodkdnjigaaodph) the article exposing the truth will be visible on the page itself. So if you come across a fake news article the extension will warn you by showing the related articles written by Remedia users.

The Chrome extension allows you to substitute clickbait or misleading titles with your own, and because this is a crowdsourcing social network, others will be able to see your work and you will be able to see others as well.

The Chrome extension can be found at [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/remedia/lhikhmhnjmdjgioifdodkdnjigaaodph](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/remedia/lhikhmhnjmdjgioifdodkdnjigaaodph)

When you install the extension you will see other people's contributions and if you log in, you will be able to contribute also.

The social network is [https://remedia.social](https://remedia.social/)

The below screenshots illustrate how the user with the extension will see the alternate titles made by Remedia users

The platform also allows users to:

* Dislike certain aricles
* Write opinions about articles, products, people...
* Write claim reviews

All content written by users, when matched with a page, will be visible to the user by the Remedia Chrome extension

&#x200B;

If you have questions feel free to ask.. or just install the extension and have fun

P.S. The screenshots are in Croatian :-)

"“Electric cars do more harm than good to our climate”, “Vaccines cause autism”, “5G is deadly to humans"" - Try our free AI powered fact-checking tool!","Tired of your uncle making up claims during family dinner? Fact-check claims faster using AI!

At Factiverse we use AI, ML, and NLP to help researchers and journalists find the most reliable sources. We have just launched our demo, which gives you the option to check any claim or to copy your own text and check all the claims of it.

The AI is built from 12 years of research at University of Stavanger in Norway. It's trained on global fact-checking articles to identify traits and signs of credibility. We scan the entire web (not just google) to find the most credible sources.

In contrast to other fact-checkers, we do not want to tell you what’s true or not - because if we want to combat the spread of fake news we need to become better at identifying it and assessing sources on our own. We do believe AI and tech can make this a faster process, and give you a faster overview of a given subject, topic or claim.

We are at an early stage but if you want to have a look and test our demo, you can find it here:

[https://factiverse.github.io/ai-editor/](https://factiverse.github.io/ai-editor/)

To use it:

1. Select a claim or type your own to get an overview of the sources disputing, supporting or conflicting it.
2. Copy your own text and easily fact-check claims to see how balanced your story is.

Our goal is to make it faster and easier for people to understand the information around given topics - how much is disputed? How much research is done on the subject? What are the most reliable sources on both sides of the claim?

What do you think? Is this a tool that could help promote critical thinking? We want to build more interactiveness so that you would get prompts about thinking twice, checking what sources there are etc..

"Hi, Is That One Arma 3 Footage News Fake?"," 

In a bizarre development, some Indian news broadcasts claimed that the Pakistani airforce attacked the Panjshir valley, an Afghanistan mountain province home to about 170,000 people, which is currently the last major holdout of anti-Taliban forces. 

The only problem? The footage used to report the supposedly pro-Taliban airforce attack came from the popular military simulation game Arma 3.

The footage first appeared on Indian news channels including Republic TV, Times Now Navbharat, Zee Hindustan, and TV9 Bharatvarsh. The original video was credited to a source called ""Hasti TV"" on Facebook, which has since been deleted. These Indian news sources claimed the video showed a military jet attempting a bombing run on Panjshir. (credit to PCGAMER)",F,2021-10-04 07:44:02
Why is this story only being covered by publications whose web domains originate in SE Asian countries?,"There is a picture of Joe Biden pinning a girl in a dugout circulating the internet and im trying to figure out if it is legit or doctored. So far, the OP of the reddit thread has linked to two sources, one from Vietnam(according to Google, IP is based in US) and one from Singapore(IP Address) whose name shares that of a province in Nepal. I'm mostly interested in why these domains are mostly linked to countries in SE Asia(one being named after a province of Nepal and having an IP address in Singapore and the other being linked to Vietnam despite having an IP address in the US).

My hunch is that these countries(Vietnam and Singapore) don't prosecute libel on a consistent basis but thats why I'm here. Does anybody here know why somebody who would want to circulate an edited image would choose to do so from a company that is registered in either Vietnam or Singapore? The image could be real, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it and find out what's true.",F,2021-10-01 04:06:41

Is the story of Mike Emme real?,"Hello. I'm working on a Suicide Prevention Project for my university in Brazil. Here, we have something called Yellow September, which is a month dedicated to suicide prevention. While searching about the origins of Yellow September, I keep finding results (in portuguese) about a teenager called Mike Emme, who killed himself in his yellow mustang in 1994. The parents of the victim, allegedly, distributed yellow ribbons at his funneral, which inspired the association between the collor yellow and suicide prevention.

The thing is, I tried to find this story on english sources, but couldnt find anything, except this website, which is supposed to be a suicide prevention organization in the U.S.

[https://yellowribbon.org/who-we-are/our-story.html](https://yellowribbon.org/who-we-are/our-story.html)

The people who wrote this webpage claim to be affiliated with the parents of Mike Emme. I find it very suspecious, though, that the only website where I can find local information (that is, not written by brazilian writters) about this case is one that is directly involved in the incident. No news report, no wikipedia page, no anything about Mike Emme other than the webpage of the institution inspired by him.

Can anyone help me clarify this matter? Is this website trustable? Is Mike Emme's story real, or just a tale designed to inspire people towards suicide prevention?",F,2021-09-08 21:29:04

The largest countries with the largest delegations of athletes to the Olympics participating in the largest amount of individual events win the largest amounts of medals. How is that possible? Who'd have thunk? - Does this constitute 'Fake News'?,"See [here](https://i.redd.it/vavha2vn72g71.jpg) for the current situation.

I never understood how people can subscribe to this patent nonsense. What an exercise in futility to keep score of medals this way.

Let's see... Which countries have the largest delegations of athletes participating? Which country's athletes participate in the largest amount of individual events?

Oh look... Gee. Isn't it a huge achievement that these large groups doing these large amount of events also collect the largest amount of medals?

Ehhh.... NO! It isn't!

A list counting the absolute number of medals is totally and utterly MEANINGLESS!!!

I can't be bothered to even look at it. Not worth my time.

The ONLY relevant comparison is amount of medals per 100 athletes and/or amount of medals per 100 events these athletes participated in.

The ONLY!

THAT list would be interesting and would quite possibly be vastly different.

Man claims catastrophically severe side-effects due to a FDA-approved drug purchased over the internet but he's not able to demonstrate a correlation and no physician has prescribed it to him,"In the last decade we have seen a lot of anecdotes around the web about a condition generically called Post Finasteride Syndrome. This syndrome with a constellation of self-reported symptoms is claimed to generate irreversible side effects. However physicians and the clinical studies have established no organic and/or tangible damages after the administration of finasteride. Basically it's what science calls nocebo effect. All physicians agree with the presence of psychiatric issues (probably pre-existing in these patients) and recommend a treatment with antidepressants. Even nowadays pharmacovigilance and medical literature have strictly declined the existence of this syndrome and they remark that finasteride is a safe and effective drug proved by a thousand of scientific studies (double-blind randomized controlled trials aka the highest-quality studies). Recently however I have read another anecdote around the web about this drug called finasteride. The link is the follow [https://www.armaghi.com/news/armagh-news/severe-side-effects-of-internet-bought-hair-loss-pill-has-taken-everything-from-armagh-man/104313](https://www.armaghi.com/news/armagh-news/severe-side-effects-of-internet-bought-hair-loss-pill-has-taken-everything-from-armagh-man/104313) The man (Ryan Ò Floinn) claims that a single pill of finasteride has generated immediately catastrophic severe side-effects in his body. From the article, however, he admits that he purchased the drug over the internet without a medical prescription and he assumed it without doctor's opinion. At this point, there are 4 things to observe: a) Buy a drug illegally via a non-authorized pharmacy without the assurance of the presence of the active ingredient it's simply stupid. Nobody knows about the integrity of the product. b) An awful reaction after 20 minutes is basically an allergic reaction but, as stated before, nobody knows about the integrity of the product purchased over the internet. c) He claims his perfect health status before the ingestion of that drug, but nobody knows his real clinical history. d) Even with claimed catastrophic side effects he's not able to demonstrate his condition with blood exams and/or a medical report.

Some time ago I have even read a man who claimed that a shampoo has destroyed his life.

I have attached also a couple of screenshots from PH, a controversial website about PFS. [https://i.imgur.com/vUZECIo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vUZECIo.jpg) [https://i.imgur.com/nFlqGXC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nFlqGXC.jpg)

Throwing People Under the Bus,"They deny the virus but fear 5G. 

Here is the thing, the primary motivation behind the deniers is the desire for normalcy to come back to their lives. They are willing to sacrifice their countrymen to the cause of their freedom (well more so inconveniences). The collaborators in occupied France did the same damn thing, they ignored the ""truth"" some went out of their way to get more people killed for the same motivation. 

You have to look at base human nature, what motivates people to do things. And to counter the Freedom excuse, we still have freedom of the media, the electoral system is unaltered (look south of the border for voter suppression examples) and our court system is untouched including the Charter of Rights. These activists don't like the message of the media so they say it is corrupt, now a dictatorship is in place (federal, provincial and municipal) yet they fail to realize they can be voted out of office. The entire medical field is corrupt (except for those two doctors in Alberta that support their cause). 

In closing it is interesting to see numerous governments and all levels of the medical community put forward such an elaborate scheme in order to create an Orwellian system with the support of the media (from national to local). The only thing missing from this recipe is aliens.

China uncensored.....,So there is a string of channels one of them being China uncensored that report “news” on China. This “news” ropes America into just about every situation that is reported on. There is no information anywhere on the host Chris Chappell except information from websites like Chinauncensored.com so not very reliable. He runs multiple other “news” channels that have the same outlandish claims and stories. At some point I read that there was a bit of satire in it but it seems like he’s playing all this off as legitimate news and people in the comments believe it. He also constantly plugs his patreon and even Bitcoin. There are a few other channels that have nothing but videos about China and how terrible they are. I think this might be the CCP itself using western social media to spread its propaganda. What’s funny is that I read that this Chris Chappell guy has a company called America Uncovered.

"""Us and China Just Have Cultural Differences"" 👀","Mao Tse-tung took control of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 and declared the beginning of a Hundred-Year Marathon to become the worlds leading superpower. Intelligence expert Mike Pillsbury wrote this book as mandatory reading for American foreign policy advisors in the wake of their new supreme leader Xi. Americans see ourself as the world superpower, how could you not while spending $4T/yr on the military? Theres a war as cold as ice underway, it continues to drop in temperature the further we wade into an age of digital disinformation, covert coups and nonlinear warfare. This time the wager is a bit higher than staking a flag on the moon, we’re talking about the race to become the head of the hydra, leader of a federation of nations.

No doubt we’re top shit in the U S of A, but who’s to say other countries cant take a shot at the title? The US is twenty plus trillion dollars in debt to China, meanwhile Nike and Apple lobby against child labor laws in their country. This show is a balanced commentary on the past millennium where China was beholden to the British Empire via the opium trade, much like China influencing the American opioid epidemic with fentanyl. We’ll weigh into the equation gaffs of government like the 1949 Chinese event that shall not be named where protestors were flattened to pancakes. How does this compare to Big Tech censorship in the US where million man marches are ignored by the corporate media if it does not fit their global narrative. Beware the empathy effect, analyzing a foreign totalitarian may make you realize the authoritarian in your own mayors. Ben Franklin said it best, “Love your enemies, for they tell you your faults”. China Numba Won!

"""Corporate Media is the Theatrical Arm of the Military Industrial Complex""","*Propaganda and the Public Mind*, takes you back to 8th grade civics to re-examine some fundamental questions of government. How can a congressman possibly read a proposed 5,000 page stimulus bill when the vote is in 4 hours? Why are the Board of Governors, a subcommittee of the Federal Reserve, responsible for auditing the Fed? Why does the World Trade Organization have more of a say on where manufacturing jobs are sent than the workers within its democratic nation? How come a UN Charter decides when America goes to war instead of a supermajority vote by congress? The answer to all of these questions… lizards.

Noam is the counterpart to the Ike school of ‘critical thinking’ based on following latent symbology. Did you just scratch your left ear with your right hand? Illuminati confirmed. Through the late 20th century Chomsky remained the only investigative reporter willing to blow the whistle on crimes of humanity in East Timor while on his AM radio and college speaking tour. Chomsky’s skepticism outlasts the test of time as he urges educators to instill the ability to question into their pupils. A fanatic of the scientific method, Richard Feynman, said it best while working on the Manhattan project, “I’d rather have questions that can’t be answered than answers that can’t be questioned”.

Local News Media covering up Chevron's huge oil spill in Richmond California.,"You just know that any huge Oil Company is going to underestimate the amount of oil spilled in any given ""accident"", it seems all local news media in the SF Bay Area are on the take from Chevron.  The news article I posted in MHO is fake news. It's news provided by and paid for by Chevron.

To summarize:  On the morning of February 10th 2021, Chevron issued a statement the morning of the spill as a ""hydrocarbon leak"" at their Richmond Chevron refinery.  Initial amount of oil spilled was stated by Chevron to be about 600 gallons spilled into the Bay. That number hasn't changed at all or speculated upon by any of the major local news outlets.  At 8:45pm the night of the spill, ""local"" officials called ""All Clear"" for what is probably twice the amount of actual oil spilled.  No news coverage since then.",F,2021-02-13 18:31:48

Turtleboy stories are unfounded and they use listeners as cash cows,Here at Justice League we have covered several stories. We have tracked down several people in their stories and determine that every story we investigated we all false and outright lies by Turtleboy. We have stories we can not report on because the people and or families ask us not to and some of their stories are destroying and would ruin anyone. Some stories show how police have directly interfere with public right’s but unfortunately due to threat’s made by police the people are afraid to come forward. Turtleboy Sports has friends in the police who directly harassed people for going against Turtleboy legally and have refused to serve documents to him! Turtle Riders is another word of supporters of Turtleboy and are under the understanding that Turtleboy tells the truth about stories and unfortunately believe he is a valuable asset to them. If their supporters even made the smallest attempt to look into the stories they would never listen to him again. The other thing is Turtleboy exacerbates the amount of supporters he really has Wich from what we can tell is only a couple of hundred to a thousand. Not the 12 thousand he claims like he did when he lied about when he said he had 200K in the past and got caught. If any of you “Turtle Riders” ever listen to them you’ll continue to hear their most repeated sayings “we need support” either for being sued or for a lawyer for a restraining order or other legal battles. Doesn’t anyone ask why they are continuing to have legal battles? Because they are always commiting acts unlawfully against good people with their false stories. To any “Turtle Riders” you want drama watch TV because your only waiting time and sending in donations to a guy who has more restraining order’s because they post fake stories then beg for money to help them then never show up to court and even asking for money to help them they right out say they’re not going to court. This has been said over and over again on the past. Please keep your money safe and away from Turtleboy. You work hard for it and Aidan does not. His wife does but why are you supporting a bum. Now Turtleboy stated they are not doing a live show tonight because of depression ￼ and that’s absolutely not true. They are not doing a live show due to being invited out for a superbowl party expected to go into the late night hour’s not due to depression told to us by someone going to the party. Turtleboy uses the sympathetic hearts of their listeners after crying about their trouble to BEG for money and CRIES about being the victim when they have legal battles but they are the victimizers. Listen to many videos and you will see what we are saying is true. Supporting Turtleboy is like supporting a government official that has been known to steal.,F,2021-02-07 23:52:08
"Which UK news sites, and sites in general, are trustworthy and which ones are fake news?","So my boyfriend was just panicking because a news site called express.co.uk has posted multiple articles about a world war 3 scare, clearly looking for clicks, and they're the only site who have said anything on it. I've decided I don't trust this site but I don't know which sites I can trust, so if anyone could tell me some to stay away from and some that are reliable that'd be very helpful (sorry if this doesn't belong here)",F,2021-02-06 18:27:18
How to Combat Fake News,"In my opinion the two most important cause of proliferation of fake news is clickbait and hoaxes. The majority of the popular application YouTube which is where I see the majority of the news about things like the election and coronavirus. This application however is notoriously known for something called clickbait which is essentially putting a false image as the cover for a video and enticing people into watching it when in reality it doesn’t actually have what the cover displays in the video. I would say the majority of videos are clickbait especially when it comes to the biggest Youtubers they systematically use clickbait to entice people and it is the reason why the application has become such a cesspool where people with good content and with real news and information are not heard and clickbait videos run away with the views. 
	The proliferation of fake news called hoaxes is another main cause. Hoaxes happen almost daily and are something that people frequently buy into and believe full heartedly. An example of a fake news hoax that happened recently is my favorite rapper by the name of lil uzi vert had a hoax blow up saying that he was dead this led to many fans say their condolences and the internet to go crazy. It wasn’t until he actually came on social media and addressed this hoax and cleared the air but things like this happen all the time and make it hard to believe when something actually happens or someone actually dies. 
	Things that I do on an individual level to combat fake news are to make sure I don’t immediately buy into what I see on the internet and fact check my sources. Also, I make sure to view only news sources I trust which is normally BBC. On a societal level the social changes I can make to combat fake news are to not believe what everyone says. People telling me fake news and false facts happens almost daily it is something that is very frustrating and it makes me stay on my toes because you just truly can’t believe everything you hear especially in today’s day and age. On an organizational level what businesses and organizations could combat fake news by doing things like keeping employees/members informed so that way they aren’t listened to word of mouth or any other source of fake news. If I could design an application to fight against fake news I would make an app that would monitor all news outlets and stories and told you whether or not it was fake news so you could either submit an article or whatever you are curious about on the app or you could view the top news stories that it looks into daily. I believe this would be a good way to combat fake news and it would be essentially a fact checker that could keep people in the know about events and avoid confusion with fake news.",F,2021-02-01 07:33:44

Calling Everything Fake News,"Question everything is what comes to mind when fake news is brought up. Think for yourself and find your own truth. 

The difference between these two is when someone in an authority position calls everything fake news they aren’t asking you to question everything, they are telling you to believe them with out question as they are the sole purveyors of truth. 

What’s worse is when dissidents do fact check the ‘sole purveyor of truth’ they are ignored as requested as they are fake news. So no matter how easy it is to find a more objective truth through  research or an open mind, masses close their mind and believe what their bias already suggested and what their truth teller, whether a person or organization, has already told them. 

How do you reach these people? How do you get them to question everything yet again and to think for themselves?

#ItaliyDidIt Leonardo story of Italian Hacker Affidavit raises some serious red flags,"Hi all, [ItsMrZombie here from TikTok](https://m.tiktok.com/h5/share/usr/6898100026440451078.html?_d=dfhh3761dliic8&language=en&sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAfifg9f7QmQIQwLyGnM85RRxFMXS1K6RSpPv_WDe91jMFIEYATeNQX29zj8Pb2XL_&share_author_id=6898100026440451078&u_code=dfhh36j177m9dd&timestamp=1610230377&user_id=6898100026440451078&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAfifg9f7QmQIQwLyGnM85RRxFMXS1K6RSpPv_WDe91jMFIEYATeNQX29zj8Pb2XL_&utm_source=copy&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=android&share_app_name=musically&share_iid=6912656345897010949&share_link_id=b87d1f04-55e0-40a8-8fee-12f6a21e1214), a conservative republican. Just wanted to share some major red flags I found on the ItalyGate / Italy Did It story: 

I hope this is the right place to be posting something like this.

The Leonardo story is starting to go viral, so I (a conservative) did a deep dive into the organization ""Nations in Action"" (NIA going forward) [pushing this story](https://nationsinaction.org/2021/01/press-release-voter-fraud/), and found some things that raised some pretty big red flags - and feel it's my duty to share this info to stem the spread of misinformation (if it end up being fake).

[Here's my 60-second explanation](https://www.tiktok.com/@itsmrzombie/video/6915329894306172166) of NIA organization

and a [60 second look into Maria Zack](https://www.tiktok.com/@itsmrzombie/video/6915323463624396038)

**First Red Flag:**

To do a quick breakdown, NIA references an Italian editorial section and a youtube video by an alleged former CIA agent, Brad Johnson (Who owns IntelReform.org).

The Italian newspaper references an interview between a Brad Johnson and Intelreform (how does one interview him/her self?) and also references NIA.

IntelReform references the Italian newspaper and NIA.

That triangle of references raised a led flag for me and led me to dig deeper into NIA...

**Second Red Flag:**

NIA is owned by a Maria Zack - the lady in the video interviews. Maria Zack is a former lobbyist from Georgia (She lives in Florida now). Lobbyists are good at 2 things: Talking to people and raising money. And she mentions 3 times about needing money to 'see this through'.

**Third Red Flag:**

The timing of the story breaking (Jan 6th) rang some bells for me, so I decided to look into the NIA organization's website - what other content / press releases do they have?

I started by going back in time with [Archive.org](https://Archive.org) \- turns out that the story ""broke"" January 6th. Odd, but not a smoking gun.

So lets go back to Jan 5th then?

BAM. Red flag.

\- Jan 6th, their website claims the following:

>Nations In Action Is Instrumental in Uncovering the Greatest Election Fraud in American History.

Jan 5th, the statement *was different*, with no mention of election fraud and no mention of this ""breaking news"":

>THE VOICE OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY  
>  
>Working for the success of our nations families by advocating for government accountability, transparency, the rule of law, and the Godly principles upon which our great nation was founded.

and for shits and giggles, I went further back and saw that their site was re-designed after november 3rd 2020, and from 2017 to early 2020, it was a simple 1-page ""landing page"" for ?donations? ...

odd, right? Why would the references pointing to the website that just recently changed their home page to look like it's fighting election fraud?

**4th Red Flag:**

The affidavit linked to in the press release on NIA is what seems to be a cell phone picture of a document uploaded to a Google Drive - by inspecting the details, I found the name of the owner of the upload. The same name happens to own the company that re-did NIA's website - Dreamwebtec.

Not only that, but the affidavit, allegedly signed in Italy, by an Italian hacker is in ENGLISH and also not notarized.

**My Take:**

It's my belief that this affidavit and story are full of holes, and the tightly knit ""reference circle jerk"", combined with the requests for donations, makes me think that this is an attempt to play on the hopes of Trump Supporters and defraud them of Donations to 'help the cause'

**/end**

Anyways, these are just some red flags I found and wanted to share. There are smarter people than I out there in the ether, and I would like to hand this off to them to follow up on and look into.

As much as I'd want to see proof of actual fraud, I oppose misinformation in a time where the republican party is suffering from severe emotional whiplash, and I believe that misinformation will only further kill the spirit of the republican party while making them the laughing stock of the left for ""grasping at straws"".

Kind of bummed, but I know/knew that talking about (even when I'm disproving them) fringe theories/conspiracies had risks. Hopefully TikTok manually reviews my content instead ignoring it.

**Big King Willy of the Neverlands kicks Mark Prutten out of parliament after dreadful Christmas celebrations. The People are delighted with this achievement. Hoping to return to the new new normal, which should be more like the old normal.**

The king said Christmas celebrations were horrendous this year. This is why he had to pull the plug on Mark Prutten's reign of insanity. The Neverlands was recently called Mythomanialand by several Dutchy farmers (Broertjes) earlier this year after they were unable to correctly trade in their Marijuana. Big King Willy thought this was one step to far and decided to take extreme measurements.

A few months ago the FUC medical research center in Hamsterdam discovered that Marijuana can be used as a good cure of the Corbola virus. According to the king, Mark Prutten was plotting to place high taxes on Marijuana so he could line his mother's pockets with money.

The King said, ""what about the farmers. They also need money, and little faggots like Mark Prutten don't even make children."" The King has children he knows what it's like to grow new people. But Mark Prutten is a faggot. He just simply does not comprehend, he would rather take it up the batty.

Being such a good family man. Big King Willy and the rest of the Dutch Citizens, decided it would be best if we get rid of Mark Prutten. This because he is simply too gay to rule a country as good as the Neverlands. This has been proven after is catastrophic rule during the Corbola Plandemic.

Big King Willy says, farmers will be allowed to trade all their Marijuana tax free for five years. This to help them regain damage taken to their economy. After six years, we will start looking into a better tax scheme and better regulation of the market. As long as we all survive Billy Gates' Nanotechnology Corbola Plandemic Vaccine and Nole Musky Bacon hasn't already enslaved us all with a chip in our brains.

"Clintons Host Trumps, Obamas: Mole Children on the Table?","Ahead of the December 21st arrival of the USNS Comfort at Guantanamo Bay, the Clintons will reportedly host the Trumps and Obama’s at their Atlantisian lair off the cost of Epstein island on Sunday.

Sources with knowledge of the situation informed me that the poisonous parlay is purported to be based around the pivotal issue regarding the fate of the formerly subterranean cabal smorgasbord that is the thousands of mouth watering Mole Children packed like delectable sardines aboard the Comfort.

The April liberation of the Mole Children, spearheaded by the glorious Governor Cuomo and widely praised at the time for its humanitarian contributions to the zeitgeist, has been exposed as nothing more than a sinister goalpost in the deplorable plight of the innocent “Moleies.” This week’s leak of a communique issued from the desk of POTUS to Attorney General Barr ordering him to divert the Comfort to Guantanamo Bay has lead to the revelation of TPTB’s true disgusting plan for the ultimate fate of the precious “Moleies”: Operation Lock Them Up.

TPTB know that the world is waking up. They can see that the new prophet, Billy Strings, has awoken the masses in numbers not seen since William Blake. Operation Lock Them Up is their final attempt at crushing the light. In short order, Kamala Harris will bring about a case of conspiracy linking all the living Presidents (except, of course, Jimmy Carter, because no fucking way he’s into this shit) to collusion with Russia & China. Biden, Trump, Obama, Clinton, and Bush (hell, they may throw Gore in just for kicks) and their families and Dave Chappelle’s clone will be sentenced to life In Guantanamo. There, they will live in lavish ecstasy, dining on fine Mole Child each day. Us plebs will be left to be sold as slaves to the Galactic Federation. Thanks a lot, Trump.

**After months of research and the race to find a vaccine for the Corbola-91 virus the world was engulfed by starting at the end of October in 2019, the FUC Medical Research Center in Hamsterdam have been in competition with other major vaccine firms to come up with a cure. The FUC claims they have found the most effective cure. Other reseachers have already tested the vaccine on patience at the FUMC Medical Care facility nearby and has proven to be effective 100% of all cases.**

The study performed by the bottom of the top of the scientologists in The Neverlands released a study today which suggests that Marijuana is the best cure for the Corbola Virus. Recently we imported different strains from different countries all over the world Mark Prutten said in a meeting today.

The FUC have been working hard to create the perfect strain to combat the Corbola virus. After deep research, evidence suggests, any strain of the Marijuana plant is perfect for building an immunity towards the Corbola virus. Any means of consumption is advisory, be it in edible form, smoked or vaporized and inhaled seems to have a majorly positive effect on immunity.

Since the latest discovery, Mark Prutten is going to make a new ""spoedwet,"" after his recent legalization of marijuana trade, to replace the mandatory face mask law with a mandatory CBD and THC consumption law, where every citizen will be enforced to smoke weed first thing in the morning. This in effort to fight the Corbola virus.

After a meeting with the treasury, Mark Prutten has confirmed, every citizen in the Neverlands should be able to pay for the Cannabis through their Health Insurance policies once laws have passed hopefully by the end of the week.

Recognizing Bias,"1.Do you tend to listen to one media source? 

Google and youtube are familiar media sources that I use to explore information online. I search up recommendations or hotspots on Google and often watch them on youtube. The most resources I found were useful and precise, such as the gunpowder I made last week with Google and Wikihow. The internet is a network that provides a variety of information and communication facilities; the internet allows us to find information efficiently. We had to wait for days to receive a reply to a letter in the past, but now it only takes a few seconds with the internet's help. However, going online also means that we will encounter lousy information, including ""fake news.""

1.How does that affect your understanding of the events being covered?

In my opinion, false information like fake news cannot be wholly prevented. There was fake news when the internet was not even invented. The story of a Chinese military general called Yuefei is a good example. Although Yuefei won many battles and was very loyal and essential to the emperor, the emperor still executed him because of fake news that described how Yuefei would betray the country.

From Yuefei's story, I also realized that fake news could cause serious issues that are Injustice and are spread for a variety of possibilities. As for, in the story of Yuefei, fake news causing his death was spread by villains to kill Yuefei and take his position as the general. We can see that most fake news nowadays describe Incredible events like serial murders because reporters and social media mostly spread them to attract audiences to earn profits. Fake news that aims to attract an audience can be very harmful. Since it is difficult for netizens to identify fake news by going to the site where an event has happened and proof it by themselves, most of them will spread the false information within the internet as ""real"" news. 

A Quantum Mechanics Experiment called Schrodinger's Cat can be used to describe this phenomenon. The experiment concludes that if a cat is inside a sealed room with a radioactive device that triggers a poison that will kill the cat but without an observer to witness the cat's death, the cat is considered dead and alive. Although the experiment does not contain any scientific basis, I still think that the experiment's thought can be used to describe fake news. When netizens cannot observe the proof of fake news, then with enough people believing in it, the news will become ""real,"" and the negative impacts caused by its content will also come true.

2.How do you think fake news could influence a person's beliefs?

The case of an innocent man been wrongly executed in China called Hugejiletu strengthened my mind. Hugejiletu is a young teenager known to be blamed for murdering a woman in a public toilet and executed at only 18. However, after eight years of his execution, he was proven innocent, which shocked everyone since they all believed that Hugejiletu was the actual murderer. This tragedy is caused by the police's incompetence and fake news that affected people's beliefs.

Before Huhejiletu's execution, many media published fake news about physical evidence that could prove Hugejiletu guilty, including discovering his blood on the victim. However, The only evidence that the police collected was Hugejiletu walking by the public toilet where the murder had happened. The fake news leads the police to suspect Hugejiletu even more, and the further consequences are irreversible. It not only caused Hugejiletu's death but also harmed his entire family. His parents had to bear both sadness and public infamous for their entire life; even his brothers and sisters were often bullied at school because they have a ""murderer"" in their family. The story of Hugejiletu had made people sigh, but it also allowed us to see the potential harm of fake news. In Hugejiletu's case, fake news changed people's thoughts, causing them to believe that an innocent teenager is a murderer. 

From the above, I tend to believe that fake news is false information spread to attract an audience that can become ""real"" news if many netizens follow the lead. Search engines and social media should prevent fake news from being published to ease the harm; one way to do this is by setting up strict verifications.",F,2020-12-03 04:46:28

Marketing Research Survey,"Hello Reddit,

Please take a moment to complete the survey linked below for my Marketing Research Course at Washington State University. Please answer the questions thoughtfully, based on your initial reaction to the graphic provided.

In this day and age of photoshop, video editing, and even voice-overs, fake news is being constantly circulated through social media and various news outlets of different pedigrees. I am interested in studying how difficult it is for readers to identify fake news, and how much people trust different news outlets. After the 2016 election, the term “fake news” became a huge concern for the public. Since then the impact of misinformation has been extremely harmful for public perception on almost every single hot topic in the media. I chose to do this experimental project due to my own frustration with the amount of misinformation specifically surrounding the upcoming election, I myself will use the results from this project to better understand how to avoid fake news, and learn more about what it is that makes people trust what they see on the internet.

"Sad Covid story, but author resorts to misinformation and propaganda","I was reading this story today and while I feel sad for author's family loss, I can't help to notice that author makes some politically motivated and wrong conclusions.

""The President's callous words swirling in my head after my mother's death from Covid-19""

[https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/opinions/presidents-callous-words-covid-19-skjolsvik/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/opinions/presidents-callous-words-covid-19-skjolsvik/index.html)

Here are just some of my observations. These are just IMHO, you don't have to agree of course.

First, constant mentioning of Trump is annoying. He has his flaws, but to blame him for her mother's death is unfair. Facility of elderly people where her father was infected with Covid is clearly at fault here.

Second, she keeps saying that her parents were Republicans, but how does their political affiliation matter in this story? Would the outcome be any different if they were Democrats? I don't think so. Her mother was taking all precautions (wearing a mask while out and washing hands) and it helped her not to contract Covid at the stores and other public places. What got her infected was her husband who in turn got infected at senior care center. 

Third, she's talking about her mother being so active and healthy that a reader would think she's fairly young, probably in her 50-60. And then in the end the author states that mother was 88 years old and healthy. 88!!!! Most of us will never get to live to that age (Sean Connery died today and he was just 80) and if we do - we will have major health problems. My father passed away at 82 and it was easier to say what illness he didn't have at his age. This lady was 6 years older and to say she was perfectly healthy is a stretch.

Finally, she keeps referring to Trump's speedy recovery from Covid. What does she expect - as a President he has the best health care in the world with top doctors and treatments. Most of us, including her mother do not have this luxury. And Trump is much younger than her mother, which makes huge difference. BTW, this top notch care is provided to all top politicians in case they get sick, I can guarantee if Pence, Biden, Harris, Pelosi, McConnell, SCOTUS Judge or any member of Senator/Congress/State government get infected with Covid chances of them dying are virtually non-existent. Do you know of  of any high level politician who died from Covid? They are just in different league than most of us.

"We want to make a fake news related app for school, but we need opinions!","Hello lovely people!

Our names are Michelle, Ruben & Malvin. We are 3 students from the Netherlands. We study Multimedia Design & Communication. We are conducting research on fake news and the impact it has on certain groups. Our target audience is children who argue with parents about them spreading said fake news or believing in conspiracy theories. Since two members of our group have the same issues with their parents, it only felt natural to do so. 

After a lot of research we found out that we are far from the only ones with this issue. One of our group is already a member of this subreddit and one of them found it and is actually the one who came up with the idea to ask for opinions here.

So, we want to solve the issue where children and their parents are constantly or periodically arguing about said subjects. In research we found out that there are a lot of children who are anxious about even starting a discussion or trying to tell their parents how much it hurts.

But, since we are not psychologists, we cannot directly head-on tackle this discussion and turn it into a conversation. What we can do is offer a community-feeling which helps these victims. Unlike Reddit, we would love it to show personal growth as well. Don’t worry, we are not trying to tackle Reddit, but are just trying to get the best out of our school assignment! That doesn’t mean we don’t want the best for these victims of course, we have a lot of intrinsic motivation to try and tackle this issue.

*What we need from you lovely people, is an opinion, or ideas! We want to design an app with the goal of not needing the app anymore after a while, or to keep it to help others. So, if you guys would just like to tell us if an app like this would be a possible solution, that would be amazing. We obviously understand not everyone in this Reddit has the fake news/ conspiracy issue, but we would still like your help as well! Because the subject is just leading, but not the only subject we can maybe solve with this community app.*

**The app has a few big aspects to it:**

We want to design a community forum where people can post their stories and other people can react to it (only with an account, because we don’t want trolls to just be able to comment and we want to moderate these trolls to ban them, we want a safe environment for all).

We want to design a possibility to have a 1-on-1 chat if things are to be that bit more private, or maybe if you live close and want to meet up or Skype up!  
We want to design a diary section, which will be completely private for just you! You can post your own stories of that day, week, discussion or advancement! 

We want people with the same kind of issues to find each other by tags (open to other ways to tackle this of course).

Privacy is top priority, so accounts can be made anonymously, no need to fill in a first and last name, it will be optional to do so.

We want people to listen, share, help and get help in this community!

We will put in some educational part where conversation-tips and other tips surrounding these subjects will be available for all!

Forum posts can be read by everyone, but posted without a name. This so parents who stumble upon this app might use it to reflect on themselves. But! There is always a but: You can only react on topics if you have an account. People who posts on the forum will be able to choose to keep the forum post locked to read for only those with an account. 

*So! There are a few of the ideas and set of rules we want to design for the app. If you have any tips they are more than welcome! Also, we just want to know: Do YOU need this? Would YOU like to have an app like this? Because if we were to take this to our teachers, we would love to know if what we want to create if something people actually need!*

As front-end developer you will form part of our core development team, and will contribute to setting up the platform’s website, as well as integration with our back-end pipeline. Our team is based in 9 different countries so all work is done online. Since we’re all working on this as volunteers we have a pretty relaxed timeline, but we ask participants to contribute a couple of hours a week to the project.

To give front-end developers an idea of the website, the image below shows the design of our main “fact-check claim” page. The design is based on the [Vikinger HTML/CSS template](https://themeforest.net/item/vikinger-social-network-and-marketplace-psd-template/25263212), so the template files can be used to help facilitate website development.

[Dubio Fact-Check Claim page mockup](https://preview.redd.it/jfqpzj30lhm51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c3d1481d9b5a132b0f80b365f92e1d28519f9b1)

On the “fact-check claim” page, platform users see a “suspicious claim” from a trending online article or video, and can collaboratively submit relevant fact-checking information regarding that claim:

* A summary of the claim
* Who made the claim? When? Where?
* Relevant sources for fact-checking this claim (sources which either contradict or confirm the claim)

Users can add their own contributions to a certain claim, or upvote / downvote contributions made by other users. Once we have enough quality contributions regarding a certain claim, the various user’s fact-checking contributions are packaged and users can decide whether the claim is: “true”, “mostly true”, “misleading”, “lacking evidence”, “mostly false”, “false”, etc.

This information is then bundled into a fact-checking article and submitted to ClaimReview (which signals the fact-check to Google, Twitter, Facebook, … to inform their strategies regarding which content to promote, and which content to limit) or sent to a professional fact-checking organisation so they have all the necessary resources to write up a good fact-checking article (and signal this to Google, Twitter, Facebook, … to limit the spread of false claims).

Essentially we want to crowdsource the fact-checking process, and give regular citizens the necessary tools to fight fake news!

If you’d like more info on our community-driven fact-checking approach, please check out [our website](http://www.dubioo.com/).

**If you’re a front-end developer and want to form part of a dedicated, international team addressing the issue of fake news don’t hesitate to send me a PM**, and we’d be happy to discuss the workings of the platform (and the front-end) in more detail!",F,2020-09-11 09:38:06

This story about Chicago and gun violence always pisses me off. Why do people talk about Chicago all of the time. TLDR here is that guns in Chicago are coming from out of state, s Chicago mayor is blaming those states. Fox News turns around and says, ""Why don't those states have crime problems?""

The answer is.....THEY DO! Birmingham AL violent crime rate is twice that of Chicago. Congrats, no one does they're own research.

Instagram girl accuses CVS La Habra of falsifying COVID-9 results,"
https://instagram.com/carolina_gss?igshid=rp0upkb8epl4
This girl is trying to say that CVS falsified lab results. This being a criminal accusation, I wonder what can be done. Here’s what I posted that immediately got deleted.

***THIS LOOKS LIKE A SCAM***
Hi! Medical lab scientist here. 
1. CVS doesn’t send letters or phone calls. Those are easily falsified. 
2. CVS uses an off-site reference lab that is fully automated through a system called EPIC. At CVS, the epic system doesn’t generate identification labels unless the patient shows up. It’s called an “encounter” on the system. 
3. PCR, the testing method she said was used, is a big machine. The results transmit directly to the EPIC system that gets forwarded directly to the patient.
4. PCR cannot detect what isn’t there. It’s pitfall is in a FALSE NEGATIVE.
5. This is a criminal accusation that can lead to licenses being revoked. 
6. The nurse practitioner whose name is present and CVS have been notified
7. Do not spread false information for clout.

In it the campaign plays a video with a fake CNN bottom third on it displaying an obvious lie about the video. **THIS** is what fake news meant when we started here, somebody pretending to be a media outlet, lying about something to make either the outlet, or the subjects of the story look less trustworthy or in some way bad. 

**HOWEVER** this ad goes on to claim that the media is the problem even though they’re the ones making up this story.

It closes with some rubbish about how *only you can stop fake news* and when you *see something say something* so I’m posting it here even though this place has devolved so significantly.

News Is Hiding the Martial Law,"I don't know where to post this. So trying anywhere I can that seems appropriate. Someone else on here suggested this. I thought I would give it a try. I know the world is hell right now. But I think I may have some of you beat. We are Americans stuck in the Philippines. Not on vacation. I was working. Had no clue about Corona, until I had soldiers telling me I can't go outside! We are only renting and cannot afford rent. We have no money for food. We are allowed to go out only 1 day a week, with a special pass. It's been 3 months now! The news says that the rules are relaxed and people can go out now. All lies. We can't work. We can't go ask for help. Only 8 hours a week out to buy food. 6 of those hours are left standing in line for food. Often we can only get 5 cans of sardines, and 5 ramen noodles. For 10 people for a week.

There are death squads here. And bandits. And terrorists. And the Philippines does not have anything like food or cash aid. Not for foreigners at least. Even though I pay taxes here. On top of all that, it's been 120 degrees here. They make houses here with just a metal roof. No insulation at all. We don't have a fridge, AC, or even furniture! We do have a fan, water kettle, and rice cooker. Currently the electric bills are deferred. We have 8 kids. and I don't want to see them die. I don't want this to be the end of our lives. For those that do not know, the US Embassy offers NO HELP AT ALL to US Citizens abroad. Nothing. I will post links and e-mail quotes for those that doubt me. Heck, the US Citizens Services is not even open!

We do not have a ""goal"" for help. We are a long way to escaping. We have a child born here. Which under Philippine law makes them an illegal alien that entered the country a criminal at birth. Seriously. So after getting their passport, we will have to deal with their immigration paperwork and fees before the baby can go. I am just going to screw off rent for now. Sorry. And we just need some food, basically. Anything helps. **If someone could spare 20 bucks, I could make it keep us alive for another week maybe.** The only thing the government has done during this Martial Law, is shutdown the biggest news agency, and create the Cyber Terrorism Law, to arrest anyone complaining online. So I cannot post anything public. I can't post pictures in public here. But I can post photos from home. And I am willing to provide any documentation in private. Passport, ID, birth certificates, etc. One friend sent us a little some time ago. And Paypal worked with just an e-mail address. So that would work for me. I don't know what else.

The Biggest Fake News In America Is That The Christian Church Is Christian.,"The cause of Fascism and most bigotries in the world, as well as racism in America is the Christian Church.

In 1865 the Republican Party was created through the merger of several abolitionist groups.  From 1865 to the mid 1960s, the Republican Party led the Civil Rights movement in America, for a 100-years, until the church move from the Left/Democrats to the Right/GOP to take political control of the American Right.

From our Founding to this this period in history the church has worked against America, our Constitution, and equality.  First half-century through the  Democrats and their racism, bigotry in our society before the mid 1950s & mid 60s, and through the GOP after the Church changed political camps to this day, another half-century later.

This side the GOP are the Racist & bigot, due to the Christian religion, the Democrats are now the defenders of the Constitution for a Free & Equal America they Church has spent its entire history working against, Free People, any free people, they world over as a search into the lie about God on abortion and how it has been used as a wedge issue all over the world to push nations to the political, Fascist, Right.

Just like the Church has done here in America the last 55+years with the lie about God and abortion.

The Democrats are the Party of Civil Rights &  American Ideals of Equality, Freedom & Liberty, that the GOP had been to that personality swap and the only thing that really happened was the Christian Church changed its political bent.

*So, let's go to the wayback machine and follow it forward and back.*

Note: in 1933, there were 65M Germans and 96% of the German people were Christian, the majority Catholic, then Protestant, Jews were somewhat less than 0.75 percent of the population.

If you thought about it you might realise the foundation of the Constitution, its very backbone, is built on Equality, Freedom, Liberty for ALL Americans.  To Protect  and Defend those American Ideals for everyone who is American.  Native born or with 1-American parent anywhere in the world and naturalized citizens per Constitution.

End of McCarthyism in 1954 to Civil Rights Movement of 1964

• We have the personality swap of the Democrat & Republican parties:

*The Church & Fascism switched sides between the ending of  the McCarthy hearings, in 1954 and the Civil Rights Movement by Kennedy/LBJ in the early 1960s, where the Democrats became the party of the Constitution, Civil Rights and the GOP, who led Civil Right form its inception in 1865 to then, became the party of Christianity, oppression, racism, bigotry and politics became Fascist once more and aligned against people making their choices for themselves.*

*I’m not sure there is a more conclusive portrait of the power and influence of the Christian Church to carry this off w/o it being noticed by anyone but folks like Goldwater who sounded the alarm & went to war with the Christian Right before him other than Eisenhower’s warning of the military/industrial  complex which fits nicely with creating enemies that don’t actually exist in any world outside of delusions..*

The Christian Lie about God an abortion started during this time.  The “Free Love” era of the 1960’s.

The Fake Christian Religion Has Led Fascism Throughout History,"#  The Christian Religion And Fascism, Hand-in-Hand Throughout History

Someone on the Right took affront to my calling them a Fascist and asked me to prove they were.

 *\~ \~ \~ \~ \~*

*Easy*

*Do you defend the Constitution?*

*•Answer: NO*

*Do you defend the Rights of ALL Americans:*

*•Answer: NO*

*What has the Christian Religion & Conservative Right Politics you support done and the Church has always done through everyone's life.*

*Documented here for over a 100-years.*

*So, let's go to the wayback machine and follow it forward and back.*

Note: in 1933, there were 65M Germans and 96% of the German people were Christian, the majority Catholic, then Protestant, Jews were somewhat less than 0.75 percent of the population.  [https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/germany-jewish-population-in-1933](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/germany-jewish-population-in-1933&sa=D&ust=1590492941052000)

If you thought about it you’d realise the base of the Constitution, its very backbone is built on Equality, Freedom, Liberty, to Protect  and Defend those American Ideals for everyone who is an American.  Native born or with 1-American parent anywhere in the world.

Since being American, the only requirement to be guaranteed Constitutional Rights & Protections, one is granting everyone else the same right to live their life as you do.

As our Constitution does. [https://i.imgur.com/Yqi66YO.jpg](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://i.imgur.com/Yqi66YO.jpg&sa=D&ust=1590492941053000) 

* The only requirement to be a Patriot all of the American Right fails.

As God did in giving all Free Will to all the Republican Party & American Right don’t practice in politics or religion.

By the example Jesus left us in this life. [https://i.imgur.com/Hf7WksL.png](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://i.imgur.com/Hf7WksL.png&sa=D&ust=1590492941053000)

Our Constitution protects minorities, even minority states, as in our lower populated states and figuring out, through our Free Constitutionally Guided Republic to give small states a bigger voice in our government though the Electoral System and the distribution of electoral votes.

Have you not ever thought of the brilliance of our Founders in creating a document meant to give no one class leverage over another, no mention of “ism”;  racism, sexism, no mention of any religions, a creator could be one's parents.  That is the real miracle before us, in a single document for its “*day”*.., given the time it was created in.  

As long as we all get to practice our right to vote.

But that hasn’t  been the case, the GOP have been working against free and open elections for a long time now.

[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=the+GOP+have+been+working+against+free+and+open+elections&atb=v222-3rk&ia=web](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://duckduckgo.com/?q%3Dthe%2BGOP%2Bhave%2Bbeen%2Bworking%2Bagainst%2Bfree%2Band%2Bopen%2Belections%26atb%3Dv222-3rk%26ia%3Dweb&sa=D&ust=1590492941055000)

*NOTE: The Church absolutely needs to lose all tax exemptions and if charges or fines possible they should be high enough to bankrupt them, imho.  They have purposely broken sacred trust between a person and their God, their belief to use it against them. I would go as far as to seize the Vatican as a world museum then a thorough investigation of all its actions through history and document the evil that is man-made religion and it is all man-made.*

Community-driven platform for identifying fake news won the EUvsVirus Hackathon! We're now looking for additional team members + insight / feedback from the community,"Three weeks ago I shared a [Medium article](https://medium.com/swlh/tackling-fake-news-during-the-corona-pandemic-77c4bd8f228e) on this subreddit, discussing a potential strategy to streamline the process of identifying fake news in order to a) ensure that it is identified quickly (before gaining widespread traction) and b) to ensure that this effort is carried out worldwide and in all languages (as opposed to being concentrated in professional fact checking teams in the most developed nations).

Following feedback from friends, family and the community, I decided to submit the concept to the EUvsVirus Hackathon, and by some miracle (+ a lot of hard work on the part of our team), we won the first prize in the category ""Mitigating the spread of fake news"" (one of 37 teams to win ""first prizes"" in their respective categories, out of a total of 2160 hackathon submissions, with over 20 000 participants)!

You can find the [details of our submission here](https://devpost.com/software/community-driven-platform-for-identifying-fake-news) (including a functioning [Adobe XD front-end prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/21699f23-fc53-497e-5cbf-0e2679c3c256-5758/?fullscreen&hints=off), and our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jasonantao/eu-coronavirus-fakemash)). If you want to have a look at the other winners, you can find them [here](https://euvsvirus.org/results?fbclid=IwAR1K-vr68Txq3OYNrWq2ke9hWdKyGHU-mMabC4pgxqX_ZQ-XoU2eIgKBad0).

We now have the opportunity to take this project forward to the Matchathon (22-25 May), in order to connect with potential funders, stakeholders and experts.

However, **we are urgently looking to expand our team.** We have great front/back-end devs, we have people who are looking at the legal component, people interested in the business plan and in marketing, but what we are still missing is a **lead** **front-end designer**. We are looking for someone who is pro-active, good at what he/she does, and who is willing to volunteer a decent amount of time (since there is as yet no funding involved, we are all doing this on a voluntary basis). If you feel you could help out and want to contribute in a positive way to tackling (part of) this crisis, or if you know someone who fits that description, please contact me via pm! Just to clarify: the current platform design, as well as the name and logo, were just quickly mashed together for the Hackathon - all of this can still be changed.

Secondly, **it would be incredibly valuable to get some insight / feedback on our concept from you**, a dedicated community of people who are already doing exactly what this platform is intended for: identifying fake news. Essentially the platform would help to streamline the excellent work you guys are already doing, and ensure that the resulting content classifications database can be easily accessed by legitimate parties in order to inform their strategies for dealing with fake news content.

* If we develop this concept further, would you be interested in using such a platform? Why / why not?
* What would motivate you to keep using the platform? We are considering a strong gamification aspect (ranks, leaderboards, teams, badges for various achievements, unlocking additional platform features as you rank, ..) and believe the community aspect of the website (forums for discussion, working together with a team on reviewing the same article, ..) will be crucial in order to keep people engaged. Do you have any other suggestions?
* Do you see any ""pitfalls"" or ""holes"" in our concept? Problems we may not have considered and which need to be addressed to make this a viable solution?

Finally, if anyone has any **thoughts on the potential partners we should approach**, that would also be incredibly helpful!

* In terms of platform ""tools"" which we need, Adobe and AWS are official partners of the hackathon, so we will contact them to get access to Adobe tools (such as Adobe Stock) and AWS servers.
* We will need an ""input feed"" of content which has been flagged as ""suspicious"" and which is gaining traction (which then needs to be fact-checked by humans). We can try to develop this from scratch, but I think we should first reach out to companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, since they likely already have such algorithms in place. Are there any other parties which you think could provide this?
* We will need access to a database of content which has already been reviewed by professional fact checkers (to use as benchmark data to establish the Reliability Score of our public users). We are considering reaching out to Full Fact and the International Fact-Checking Network. Are there any other parties which you think we should contact for this?
* In terms of ""end-users"" of our content database (who can then use the content classifications to inform their strategies for dealing with different types of content) we are thinking of social media companies, news websites, content aggregators (such as news feeds), as well as other legitimate parties such as NATO, the WHO and fake news researchers. Can you think of any other potential use cases / end-users for this type of content classification database?
* In terms of funding we are essentially looking for any company / organisation / government entity who is interested in contributing to tackling this ""infodemic"", without necessarily expecting a Return on Investment (as monetising the platform is only a ""last resort"" option, and we will likely function as a non-profit). The EU Commissioner has already informed us that most of the hackathon partners he has talked to are not looking for ROI, and just want to help out, which is great. I believe there are many parties that stand to gain from less fake news (whether corona-related or otherwise), so if you can think of any organisation who might have an interest in sponsoring this platform, do let us know!",F,2020-05-06 11:36:33

How do I have a conversation with my mother who is sending misinformation?,"**Some context:**

Growing up I always observed my mom as someone who is incredibly socially compassionate with progressive/left leaning views. That said, she also views her ideals as most paramount and sometimes appears to fail to see the bigger picture/reality. She voted for Nader in 2000. She has rejected the notion of ""establishment politics"" and started to check out. She voted for Obama the first time around, but I think started feeling politically apathetic and did not vote at all in 2012.

She has always been someone who considers herself a ""free thinker"" and as a deep mistrust for mainstream news outlets. She has turned to more alternative news sources and claims to ""do the research for what is really going on."" The problem is anyone can post anything on the internet, and I believe she fails to see red flags in the websites she finds herself on.

Lately she has been sending my whole family links to Jon Rappoport's content and conspiracy theory laden articles regarding the corona virus. A cursory google search shows that he is a regular contributor to InfoWars and has also posted articles saying mental healthcare is a hoax etc.

I should also mention that she decided not to vaccinate me as a baby (I have since vaccinated myself, unbeknownst to her). She is also someone who for years would send links about chemtrails etc.

**The question:**

I get really triggered when she sends this stuff because I know her heart is in the right place and I love her, but the stuff she shares and believes is dangerous and I want to be able to have a frank conversation about it. I am afraid she will get defensive and not listen. I believe she finds comfort in feeling ""something else is going on"" or that ""someone is pulling the strings."" But I am not sure how to best approach it/what resources and fact based, yet compassionate arguments I could make to try and persuade her to at least not believe misinformation.

**TL;DR:**

How do I talk to my mom about how the misinformation she spreads is dangerous?

Thank you! Any tips/resources/links for how a concerned son can handle this would be so appreciated!",F,2020-04-20 04:30:08

This is my thoughts on why Fake News are popular.,"It is something like fiction, people hope to read or hear about news that they hoped for, even if it is far fetch or nearly impossible. So folks will google search based on things that did not happen but they hope to happen, and someone on the internet just happens to capitalize these demands and start churning up with fictional fake news with lots of imaginary details & false facts to back it up and people get addicted to it like they do with Game Of Thrones, and before you knew it, Fake news is now the good news and people choose to believe in what they believe in. It fulfills a person's sense of self satisfaction. Works especially well on political & conspiracy views since usually there's no proofs.",F,2020-04-14 02:21:13

Looking for fact checkers - Trial for decentralized fact-checkers platform,"Hi everyone, I'm sorry this is not a fake news. We're looking for fact-checkers who might be interested to try out our MVP on Telegram, and perhaps give us some advise on moving forward.   


Some of the features we're trying to push on the Realnot Platform: 

1. Trust-free platform for readers. Fact-checking conducted, will need to be reviewed, and approved by other fact-checkers before being published or shared with public. Fact-checking can be approved and rejected via an open vote by all fact-checker. 
2. Healthier platform with no capability to comment. As we see on many fact-checking groups, or even some subreddits, comments more often blur out the lines, because there can be all sorts of comments, filled with emotions, and sentiments. By not being able to comment, it gives a clear number metric, of how many fact-checkers really approve of something, even if he/she don't have anything nice to say about it. 
3. Educating the general public by showing some of the fact-checked reports that garners the highest votes. For 1 fake news, it doesn't mean that, only 1 fact-check report to be reviewed. Other fact-checkers who had done their fact-checking, or feels that they can do a better fact-check report, can submit it  for approval by other fact-checkers as well. More importantly, a good way to educate the public, can show how fact-checking is done, which indirectly shows the public, what should they look out for in a fake news. 

&#x200B;

In any case, we're looking at how far this project can go, and perhaps something can come out of it in future as a reliable fact-checking platform. The trial will start soon, and it'll be good if we can have an early group of fact-checkers to start with.

FACT OR FAKE NEWS BY TRUMP?,"This morning I watched a press conference by the President, who seems to believe that anything anyone else says, aside from himself, is ""fake news"", and no one seems to question his so called facts. One of his statements was that the US has tested more people, way more in his words, for COVID19 than any other country & that the US will be back to ""normal"" by Easter Sunday. A quick Google search (Our World In Data) seems to show that is not the case, but people believe him. I found 7 other countries have infact tested more people - China (320,000), South Korea (316,664), Italy (206,886), Germany (167,000), Russia (143,519), United Arab Emirates (125,000), Australia (113,615) then USA (103,945) as of 19/20 March.

As to the US having a vaccine soon seems unlikely when most experts are predicting the end of the year being the earliest, but maybe up to 2 years away doesn't seem to support the statement that by Easter the US will be back to normal as expected by Trump.

Again on OWID figures & allowing for USA being more than 2 months behind China & several weeks behind Italy when they reach critical cases reported, the US only has 2 countries with more cases, but is in 6th place with death total. . The data shows the reported cases & confirmed death (again the latest reported figures are lagging a few days.) Cases & deaths reported are - 

Italy     74,386/7,503

Spain   49,515/3,647

China   81,285/3,287

Iran      27,017/2,077

France 25,233/1,331

USA      68,421/1,032

Facts seem to prove the President wrong and also his prediction that by Easter the US will be back to ""normal"", which personally I can't see happening and most sensible people would say that the World is not going to be the same again, probably in many of our lifetimes, let alone in a couple of week. Hundreds of thousands of big & small businesses will close putting millions out of work & the economy is not going to recover overnight once this pandemic is declared over or beaten. It will be years before we see travel & tourist industries start to recover & we may never see cheap airline travel like we have been, as many airlines will close down and those that survive, mainly through Government ""bail outs"", will be increasing fares to recover their losses & try and repay their outstanding loans. There will be a surplus of aircraft up for sale, which is going to effect production at Boeing & Airbus & without Government assistance, both could fail, more likely Boeing of the two as they have lost sales to Airbus & only have US Government to bail the out but Airbus is a European conglomerate & have  France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain to ensure production continues.

I am not trying to predict gloom, just pointing out that the World will be a different place, maybe better in the long run, but be prepared to face a lot of changes over the next years & probably a new President in November, if elections go ahead as scheduled, which may not be the case & will have to be postponed to a late time, like the Olympic Games. Times are changing & I am starting to wonder if I can take notice of the W.H.O. now as the head seems to have become a puppet to Trump, siding with some of his views & praising the job he is doing and no longer appears to be an independent body.

Photos lacking captions or any context whatsoever,"I am interested in thoughts or some explanation of the trend in the NYT in the past few years to present photos, particularly in carousels, without any captions or context at all. They seem to be making an argument that the photo is a unique form of reporting in and of itself and that captions skew or editorialize the interpretation unnecessarily. I think this is an interesting perspective, but I find it very frustrating.

For example, frequently there will be an animated slide-show/carousel on front page. Each image will have a location indicated in a bold typeface at the top-left of the image and a plain-type photo-credit in the bottom-left. Below the slideshow there is typically a static caption describing the series. As a reader, I would like to be able to click on any photo in the slideshow to get more information: who are the people in the photo? what side are they on, what are they doing? what is the event? where in the cited city was the photo taken? Instead what happens when you click on the photo is you are taken to another page where there is a live-feed of breaking news, often with more photos, many without captions, and very often the photos in the home-page slide-show are no where to be found.

A submarine was also found to have sunk in Indonesia killing 53, and there have been at least two incidents in Asia of Covid ward disasters resulting in over 20 deaths each.

The NYT front page is an editorial about how India is misrepresenting their death toll, which closely follows what is happening, and is suitably for the front page of any newspaper.  But then the next two top articles are how CEOs are paid too much (a topic I have seen dozens of times in the NYT), and something about Jeff Bezo's ex wife and scammers.

IMO the paper has taken a major turn for the worse, becoming reminiscent of a tabloid paper in recent years with artsy but entirely irrelevant editorials littering the paper.  When I began my readership the paper was oriented towards clearly representing major events in America without political bias.  The wall street journal has much more of what I want, and reports much more concisely with less political bias clouding the objective reality of ongoing events.  

I have been considering unsubscribing for a while, and these past two weeks have been cataclysmic in my decision.",R,2021-04-26 01:28:31
Question about The Daily podcast hosted by Michael Barbaro,"This is one of my news items I listen to every morning on my Echo.  These are only 5ish minutes long, an abbreviated version of the already abbreviated The Daily you're all likely more familiar with.  At the beginning of every episode, he says something like: For the New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro...here's what you need to ...  


and whatever he says after that is just a gargled mess to my ears.  I can't for the life of me figure out what it is he's saying.  It sounds like ""to learn today"" but if that's what he is saying the words all seem to one continuous sound with no spaces between them.  


What is it he's actually saying?  This has been driving me crazy!  Like I need more things to do that, haha.  


I had the same problem with Tim Ferris, when on his podcast he asked if people wanted to subscribe to his weekly ""fiebullerfriedegg"" email which I had to get my wife to translate as ""Five Bullet Friday""",R,2021-04-23 14:35:02
"Glaring logic fails in Times articles, case in point","The Times today includes a splashy article about how right, left and center governments worldwide have succeeded or failed in containing the pandemic, or distributing vaccines.

Countries as far ranging as Brazil and South Korea and England are compared.  Whereas the observations may be interesting, the slant of the logic seems more than a little lacking when China is not even included.  Not only is it considered ground zero, but it has allowed WHO in to the very epicenter now, plus it is the most populous nation on earth, yet isn't even in lockdown.

Talk about the great big Chinese elephant in the room . . .    Sheesh.  It's like talking about the looming nuclear arming of Iran or North Korea while ignoring Israel's likely stockade, or more to the point, ignoring America's or Russia's horde.  How can an intelligent discussion of governmental leanings affecting outcomes ignore the most obvious example on the planet?

In my experience, this is often the case not only with the NYT, but with much of big media.  It's almost as if they have asked for a willing suspension of disbelief as we begin critically thinking about their theses.

"NYT: ""Knives Out"" Is a Giant Microaggression Against My Feelings as a Latina","Rian Johnson wrote and directed the amazing high school noir detective film [*Brick*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH-JeuqkNJg), although his subsequent movies, such as [*Looper*](https://www.takimag.com/article/the_scoop_on_looper_steve_sailer/), didn’t quite live up to his debut. Now he’s back with “Knives Out:”

📷Obviously, that raises the burning issue of how does the movie make a young Woman of Color \[mostly blue\] feel? The *New York Times* opinion page brings us this burning news:

>[Why I Left ‘Knives Out’ With Emotional Whiplash](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/opinion/knives-out-movie.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage)  
What it’s like to watch a movie in which your greatest fears are played for giggles.  
By Monica Castillo  
*Ms. Castillo is a film critic.*  
Nov. 27, 2019, 6:00 a.m. ET  
In “Knives Out,” the writer and director Rian Johnson pays tribute to Agatha Christie and “Clue” in a star-studded whodunit that begins with the mysterious death of the wealthy author and patriarch Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Almost every one of his heirs falls under the suspicion of the private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) at some point, including Harlan’s caretaker, Marta (Ana de Armas), a woman so pure of heart, she can’t lie without becoming physically ill. …

📷Ana de Armas is a Cuban actress who played Ryan Gosling’s holographic girlfriend in *Blade Runner 2049*. To my eye, she looks slightly less Woman of Colorish than, say, Swedish starlet [Alicia Vikander](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/11/01/14/alicia-vikander.jpg?w968h681), but Ms. Castillo totally identifies with how Ms. de Armas’s is oppressed and erased.

What the NYT Thought of Refugees Back When Immigrants Were Rightwingers (I. E. Refugees From Communism)," The dusty topic of Miami in the 1980s is back in the news, with the new Nobel laureate (sort of) in Economics Esther Duflo declaring that the boring, featureless history of Miami in the 1980s proves that low skill immigration has “[zero](https://vdare.com/posts/nobel-economist-esther-duflo-repeals-supply-and-demand-says-1980-84-miami-proves-low-skill-immigration-impact-on-wages-zero)” effect on the wages low-skilled natives, and the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://vdare.com/posts/splc-s-latest-shockeroo-stephen-miller-cited-harvard-researcher-george-borjas) revealing the scandalous news that White House aide Stephen Miller is a white nationalist because he cited Cuban-born Harvard professor of economics George Borjas’s study of Miami in the 1980s that [came to the opposite conclusion.](https://vdare.com/posts/splc-s-latest-shockeroo-stephen-miller-cited-harvard-researcher-george-borjas)

As I may have mentioned once or twice over the decades, while economists have a hard time remembering much of anything about Miami in the 1980s, the place actually got a little publicity at the time, not all of it good. One reason why economists can’t remember anything about the effects of immigration on Miami in the 1980s is crimestop, the protective stupidity that clever careerists undergo when suddenly Oceania stops being at war with Eastasia and now has always been at war with Eurasia.

As we all know now, immigrants, especially refugees, are sacred. Only veritable Nazis like Stephen Miller utter a word of criticism of migrants.

This was not always true, however. In fact, back in the 1980s, the most visible refugees in America were the fervent Latin American anti-Communist refugees from Cuba and Nicaragua pouring into Miami. Thus, the *New York Times* in 1987:

>[CAN MIAMI SAVE ITSELF?](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/19/magazine/can-miami-save-itself-a-city-beset-by-drugs-and-violence.html)  
A City Beset by Drugs and Violence  
By Robert Sherrill  
July 19, 1987, Section 6, Page 18  
… For several years now, Miami, the nation’s youngest major city (officially only 15 years older than Ronald Reagan), has had the reputation of a juvenile delinquent. …  
Expanding on that point not long ago, Javier Souto, a State Representative from Miami, told a reporter, ”Miami must seem like a foreign country to a lot of members. Here in Tallahassee, many just don’t realize the magnitude of our crime and drug problem, and what it’s like to be an immigrant.” …  
Last spring, on behalf of Cushman & Wakefield, one of the largest commercial real estate brokers in the country, the pollster Louis Harris asked 403 chief executive officers to rank 30 metropolitan areas in terms of desirability for establishing a business. Miami came in 28th; only Cleveland and Detroit were rated less appealing.  
Corporate relocation experts say that Miami – if it weren’t for those little warts like crime and drugs -would be very appealing to their clients.  
They could draw on scads of cheap labor. Wages **are 40 percent lower than the national average** and there isn’t much danger of organized resistance because only 8 percent of Miami’s work force is unionized, compared with 20 percent nationally.

I tried to cancel my NYT crossword subscription,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this, because I'm honestly super annoyed and need somewhere to rant I used the crossword section of the NYT, a fully online service because they offered a free month trial. I no longer have time for this subscription, so I attempted to cancel. 

Apparently, in 2019, you still have to call into customer care to cancel an **online subscription**. Not only that, but I was transferred to two different departments and put on hold for half an hour. When I finally connected to the correct agent, they tried to talk me out of it by listing all the ""great benefits"" I was getting with my membership. All this just to cancel my $8/month subscription. What should have been a simple online form turned into an annoying hassle.

This is such an obvious ploy to retain subscribers. They know people are uncomfortable with calling in this day and age. They are hoping that by placing barriers to cancellation they can continue to quietly take people's money. It's so slimy.

My Letter to the New York Times for hiring the racist Sarah Jeong,"To Whom It May Concern,

Your hiring of an openly racist person is completely disgusting and abhorrent.  Sarah Jeong is a despicable human being whose words are filled with hate.  The fact that you decided to overlook this in your hiring process is exactly what's wrong with American society today.  That type of rhetoric shouldn't be tolerated by ANYONE.  It certainly is unfortunate that she has been a victim of racism in her personal life, but that absolutely does not excuse her to say such hateful and hurtful words.  

Newsflash: EVERYONE can be racist, not just white people.  By you allowing this type of behavior/expression of hate clearly shows that you have no integrity whatsoever.  As long as that racist is employed, I will be joining in the growing number of boycotters of your newspaper.  I am so saddened and disappointed by your company's actions of hiring this deplorable human being.  You are only making the problems in our society worse by being okay with her words.  Absolutely disgusting.

Nosso Mundo News — George Soros investiu milhões em ações do New York Times este ano,"O bilionário húngaro-americano George Soros comprou  US$ 3 milhões em ações do New York Times.

A compra de ações por George Soros incluiu 126.400 ações da New York Times Company por meio da Soros Fund Management LLC, a empresa de investimentos do bilionário sediada em Nova York.

As ações foram avaliadas em U$ 3.046.000 no momento da compra e são mostradas em um arquivo de 15 de maio da Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dos Estados Unidos.

O investimento de Soros no New York Times foi para ações da Classe A, que são negociadas publicamente, em oposição às ações Classe B, que são de capital fechado.

O reconhecimento da compra nos registros de meados de maio da Soros Fund Management parece ser a primeira vez que George Soros investe na New York Times Company em mais de dez anos.

Dan Gainor, vice-presidente de negócios e cultura do Media Research Center, disse que, embora o valor das ações seja pequeno em relação à dimensão da empresa de Soros, seria “ingênuo” ignorar o investimento de um dos globalistas mais poderosos.

Gainor declarou:

Há muito tempo, Soros tem influenciado ou financiado diretamente uma ampla gama de operações jornalísticas, da NPR à ProPublica. Mas comprar uma participação de US $ 3 milhões no principal jornal esquerdista da América ainda é um grande passo.",R,2018-06-19 13:40:58

**The reason for the proposed change**

Assuming someone's gender identity may be felt to be akin to a form of rape or aggressive violation, however so may assuming someone's racial identity. It seems that the latter is more important.

Why not both? Rules are most effective when they can be clearly read and there is a limited number of them.

The apparent intellectual degeneration of Paul Krugman,"**This is the current subreddit topic. It's not mandatory to take part in at all, you may also post other topics in line with the rules, and other subreddit discussion topics will be posted in time.**

Paul Krugman is a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, and an Op-ed columnist for New York Times.

I used to see him referenced across the world in various media.

In the recent year it seems he's gone down a rather dark and disturbing path, posting fringe and extremist content, with strong hints of stream-of-consciousness rage and derangement.

This differs very much from what I remember from earlier years.

Together with his development, he seems to have disappeared from global media. It would stand to reason that media across the world would be far less inclined to quote someone when they could have his verbal outbursts quoted back to them as the sort of person they cite as an authority - but that's just one possibility obviously.

As an example of the Krugman I remember; praiseworthy, pedagogical and non-conspiracist: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/opinion/16krugman.html

____

With Trump, he first made repeated grave and terrible errors in judgement, blaring out a declaration of a market downturn: 

#""It really does now look like President Donald J. Trump, and markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover?"" (Nov 2016)

 https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/paul-krugman-the-economic-fallout 

Obviously the markets never turned down. It was a derangement, a hallucination of a fall that never took place. Hell, look at the market over the last 12 months. Where's the fall? 

It's an error I would expect from a very, very old person with senile dementia, not from an economist who won the Nobel Prize in the past.

Since that error of observation he's progressively degressed into paranoid conspiracy theories, posting radicalising conspiracist material that the Trump administration has a policy goal of causing gun deaths: https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/921430719557226496

Into dehumanisation reminiscent of a Nazi: https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/918826785155956737

I've noticed many more in the past, but he posts with such a frequency that it's like digging through a flood of mad, conspiracist, dehumanising, contrafactual, alternative-news bile flood in capital screaming letters. It felt disturbing just to go through 10-12 days of the flood.

**What bizarre outbursts have people noticed over the last year? Are there any that you have stored, simply out of incredulity or as examples to have yourself?**

**Is it problematic for a newspaper to have bigoted conspiracy theorists who write in capital letters listed as their op-eds, or is that just part and parcel of the new media reality?**

Alleged Ukraine call whistle blower previously connected to Mueller Russia collusion investigation and tweets of attempted coup.,"Adam Schiff recently leaked the alleged Ukraine call whistle blower's name ( [https://www.dailywire.com/news/alleged-whistleblowers-name-appears-in-transcript-released-by-schiff](https://www.dailywire.com/news/alleged-whistleblowers-name-appears-in-transcript-released-by-schiff)). As it turns out, the alleged whistle blower (Eric Ciaramella) was previously cited as a source in the Mueller report ( [https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)) regarding possible Russian influence in the firing of former FBI head, James Comey. It is unclear to what degree Schiff tried to conceal the whistle blower's identity was motivated by this prior connection to unsubstantiated claims of Russian Collusion. Concerns regarding the role the alleged whistle blower may have played in the prior unproved accusations of Russian Collusion are exacerbated by the troubling history of tweets by one of the alleged whistle blower's attorneys (Mark Zaid) regarding a coup ( [https://twitter.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/826262311560216578](https://twitter.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/826262311560216578)).

Joe Biden says racism is an institutional 'white man's problem visited on people of color' and the only way to solve it is to defeat President Trump," 

White house hopeful Joe Biden said yesterday racism in America is an institutional 'white man's problem visited on people of color.'

The former vice president argued that the solution was to defeat President Donald Trump and hold him responsible for deepening the nation's racial divide.

Biden told a small group of reporters in Washington that Trump's language can 'appeal to the worst damn instincts of human nature.'

Biden is leading his Democratic challengers for the presidential nomination in almost all polls, largely because of the support of black voters.
