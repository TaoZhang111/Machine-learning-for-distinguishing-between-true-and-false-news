news sites for sake discussion broadening purposes this subreddit we are also including memes fake quotes other bad information that spread online who involved with fake news bad information spread via direct process along these lines originators high level spreaders low level spreaders originators are individuals who actually create fake content spread often they are posttruth trolls or political propagandists there gradient from isolated trolls who do for its own sake those who actually make living off as shown when washington post interviewed an originator paul horner yearold impresario facebook fakenews empire has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years he has twice convinced internet that hes british graffiti artist banksy he also published very viral very fake news yelp vs south park lawsuit last year high level spreader larger operation blog popular facebook group fake news website that spreads material large audience with very little effort generally an originator will also run high level spreading operation at same time making easier for them finally low level spreader consumer these are users who consume fake material then also spread via likes shares fake news partisan issue no wed all like think that our side consuming real information while fake news problem other side but reality this bipartisan issue that will require people introspect little be more vigilant how they consume media hyperpartisan facebook groups have been spreading misleading information at an alarming rate while seems be bigger issue on right its problem for everyone hyperpartisan political facebook pages websites are consistently feeding their millions followers false or misleading information according an analysis by buzzfeed news review more than posts from six large hyperpartisan facebook pages selected from right from left also found that least accurate pages generated some highest numbers shares reactions comments on facebook far more than three large mainstream political news pages analyzed for comparison our analysis three hyperpartisan rightwing facebook pages found that all posts were either mixture true false or mostly false compared posts from three hyperpartisan leftwing pages that were either mixture true false or mostly false rightwing pages are among forces perhaps as potent as cable news shows that have gotten far more attention that helped fuel rise donald trump as noted this isnt simply right wing problem provide one example on other side quote spread around online about trump calling republican voters stupid was used hurt him among voters both primaries general elections issue its totally fake that viral meme your friends keep sharing donald trump calling republicans dumbest group voters country not true its not thing stop sharing while donald trump has said some questionable things he never said anything even resembling this quote if i were run id run as republican theyre dumbest group voters country they believe anything on fox news i could lie theyd still eat up i bet my numbers would be terrific post says donald made statement people magazine interview except he didnt can you provide real world example fake news process absolutely on october th wikileaks began publish contents podesta emails they were holding around this time there was story spreading online that hillary called bernie supporters bucket losers this quote was found transcript goldman sachs speech was supposedly referenced one emails infowars via american mirror published this material their web site under title hillary calls her own supporters bucket losers gateway pundit also reproduced story wikileaks hillary clinton calls bernie fans millennials bucket losers goldman sachs speech story was also spread via popular rthe_donald subreddit getting multiple posts with hundreds thousands net upvotes this example here shows being posted mods deleted all comments trying notify people story fake deleted comments are red truth story was irrelevant originator this story was fake news outfit called real true news posing as legitimate source information their story can be seen here if you pay any attention details you will notice immediately that story dated october before podesta emails began leak one could also go directly source wikileaks see search for bucket losers podesta email database returns no results if people are unwilling do ten seconds research then what else can be spread if youre fake news troll world your oyster can you provide an example spreader manipulating readers while some fake news stories are totally false lot them start with grain truth this example also from podesta emails specifically this one written by podesta himself i know she has begun hate everyday americans but i think we should use once first time she says im running for president because you everyday americans need champion i think if she doesnt say once people will notice say we false started iowa if you actually read email understand its context you will know that they are referring term everyday americans not people who make up group designated as everyday americans do you think thats what politically motivated fake news spreaders want you think usual suspects went work gatewaypundit wikileaks bombshell hillary advisors admit she hates everyday americans infowars wikileaks bombshell hillary clinton hates everyday americans written by paul joseph watson who had later take down article shame but he already got his message out right wnd hillary campaign manager i know she has begun hate everyday americans drudge season witch hates everyday americans i will focus on infowars article show further how readers are manipulated most readers have short attention spans so they do not read entire articles thats why its so important for writers know that they need either make an impression early keep reader interested or emphasis what you want at top now removed infowars story bolds their summary at very top doesnt quote statement its proper context new wikileaks emails released just moments ago include shocking admission by clinton campaign manager john podesta that hillary clinton has begun hate everyday americans another warning sign readers be skeptical sites that highlight certain sentences or words bold lettering or caps its form editorializing without explicitly editorializing by bolding words author telling reader what important but thats not their job they should be presenting information reader will decide what important paul joseph watson uses bold two more times article this shows how shady manipulative their operation i know she has begun hate everyday americans but i think we should use once first time she says im running for president because you everyday americans need champion writes podesta bolding only one part statement not providing proper explanation what statement actually meant further down this huge so if you just skimmed page you would come away with two concepts hillary hates everyday americans this story huge this subtle manipulation you may not have consciously noticed first time but your brain did can you provide good reading list learn more how fake news goes viral case study this analysis shows how fake election news stories outperformed real news on facebook facebook fakenews writer i think donald trump white

How to Combat Fake News,my opinion two most important cause proliferation fake news clickbait hoaxes majority popular application youtube which where i see majority news about things like election coronavirus this application however notoriously known for something called clickbait which essentially putting false image as cover for video enticing people into watching when reality doesnt actually have what cover displays video i would say majority videos are clickbait especially when comes biggest youtubers they systematically use clickbait entice people reason why application has become such cesspool where people with good content with real news information are not heard clickbait videos run away with views proliferation fake news called hoaxes another main cause hoaxes happen almost daily are something that people frequently buy into believe full heartedly an example fake news hoax that happened recently my favorite rapper by name lil uzi vert had hoax blow up saying that he was dead this led many fans say their condolences internet go crazy wasnt until he actually came on social media addressed this hoax cleared air but things like this happen all time make hard believe when something actually happens or someone actually dies things that i do on an individual level combat fake news are make sure i dont immediately buy into what i see on internet fact check my sources also i make sure view only news sources i trust which normally bbc on societal level social changes i can make combat fake news are not believe what everyone says people telling me fake news false facts happens almost daily something that very frustrating makes me stay on my toes because you just truly cant believe everything you hear especially todays day age on an organizational level what businesses organizations could combat fake news by doing things like keeping employeesmembers informed so that way they arent listened word mouth or any other source fake news if i could design an application fight against fake news i would make an app that would monitor all news outlets stories told you whether or not was fake news so you could either submit an article or whatever you are curious about on app or you could view top news stories that looks into daily i believe this would be good way combat fake news would be essentially fact checker that could keep people know about events avoid confusion with fake news,F,2021-02-01 07:33:44,497,0
